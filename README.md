#### By Leanne Rose Creedon ####

> _CA3 Prototype Project for Procedural Game Audio Module Year 4 Semester 1._

Developed in Unreal Engine 5.2 and MetaSound.

🎧Sounds include:

- Wind 🍂
- Rain 🌧️
- Birds 🐦
- Crickets 🦗

The user can adjust various parameters in order to create their own atmospheric ambiance.

MetaSounds were created using white noise and filtering techniques.

### 🗒️Descripton Of Application ###
Weather Ambiance set in a Low Poly 3D Environment. On the UI there are six sliders. The wind strength and rain heaviness can be increased/decreased which will effect the sound of the wind or rain procedurally. The volume of the rain, wind, birds and crickets can be changed as well. This Project aims to emulate atmospheric ambiant scenes found on YouTube that have relaxing sounds and pleasing visuals. (This would be an example of a scene with similar sounds and vibes -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NgwbEs4JE).

🔑Key Features:
* Day/Night cycle which affects whether the birds or crickets play. Text on the top of the screen which will change to read "Day" or "Night".
* The camera shakes ever so slightly to simulate the wind blowing against it.
* Rain animation which is affected by the heaviness of the rain set by the user.

🚧Incomplete Sounds and Features:
* Camera shake frequency increace/decrease with wind strength value and/or Trees & Grass animations adjust with wind strength value.
* Window lights on house turn off during day. i.e. change to another texture with no emision.
* Thunder ☁️
* Lightning 🌩️
